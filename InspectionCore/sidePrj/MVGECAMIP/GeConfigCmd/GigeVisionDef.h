Timestamp Tick Frequency Registers
These optional registers indicate the number of timestamp tick during 1 second. This corresponds to the
timestamp frequency in Hertz. For example, a 100 MHz clock would have a value of 100 000 000 =
0x05F5E100. They are combined to form a 64-bit value.
If IEEE 1588 is used, then the Timestamp Tick Frequency register must be 1 000 000 000 Hz (equivalent
to 1 GHz). This indicates that the timestamp value is reported in units of 1 ns. But the precision of the
timestamp register might be worst than 1 ns (i.e. the timestamp register does not necessarily takes all
possible values when it increments, it can skip some value depending on the precision of the IEEE 1588
clock).
Note the timestamp counter is also used to compute stream channel inter-packet delay.
No timestamp is supported if both of these registers are equal to 0.
[CR-461cd] If a device supports a device timestamp counter, then it MUST implement the
Timestamp Tick Frequency registers. Both registers MUST be available (High Part and
Low Part). If its value is set to 0 or if this register is not available, then no timestampcounter is
present. This means no mechanism is offered to control inter-packet delay. [O27-25cd]
An application needs to access the high part before accessing the low part:

These optional registers report the latched value of the timestamp counter. It is necessary to latch the 64-bit

[CR-465cd] If a device supports a device timestamp counter, then it MUST implement the
Timestamp Value registers. Both registers MUST be available (High Part and Low Part)
[CR-466ca] If an application wants to retrieve the 64-bit value of the timestamp counter and the
timestamp counter is supported by the device, it MUST write 1 into bit 30 (latch) of

[CR-467cd] The Timestamp Value register MUST always be 0 if timestamp is not supported. [CR27-

These registers do not necessarily take all possible values when they increments: they can skip some value
depending on the precision of the clock source relative to the Timestamp Tick Frequency register. For
instance, if the device supports IEEE 1588, it must report a tick frequency of 1 GHz. But the quality of the

Stream Channel Packet Size Registers (SCPSx)
These registers indicate the packet size in bytes for the given stream channel. This is the total packet size,
including all headers (IP header = 20 bytes, UDP header = 8 bytes and GVSP header). For GVSP
transmitters, they also provide a way to set the IP header “don’t fragment” bit and to send stream test packet
to the GVSP receiver.
[CR-489cd] If a device supports stream channels, it MUST implement the Stream Channel Packet
Size register for all of its supported stream channels.
Write access to this register is not possible while streaming (transmission) is active on this channel
The packet size is used by the application to determine where it has to copy the data in the receiving buffer.
As such, it is important that this value remains the same once it has been configured by the application.
[R-490st] A GVSP transmitter is allowed to round the value of the packet_size field to the nearest
supported value when the application writes to the SCPSx register. But the transmitter
MUST not change the packet size value without having the application directly writing
into this register.
For instance, it is allowed for the GVSP transmitter to round a packet size value to a multiple of 4 bytes, but
it is not allowed for the transmitter to change the packet size if the application changes the data format (such
as the image width or pixel format for a camera device).
It is recommended for the application to read back the packet size after writing to SCPSx since the value
could have been rounded by the GVSP transmitter. The application should also ensure the packet size
contains a valid value before asking for a Test Packet.

Stream Channel Packet Delay Registers (SCPDx)
These registers indicate the minimal delay (in timestamp counter unit) to insert between each packet
transmitted on a given physical link for the stream channel. This can be used as a crude flow-control
mechanism if the GVSP receiver cannot keep up with the packets coming from the device.
Note: The above essentially means that each network interface must have a separate timer per stream to
measure the inter-packet delay.

Stream Channel Source Port Registers (SCSPx)
These optional registers indicate the source UDP port for the given GVSP transmitter stream channel. The
purpose of this information is to allow the host application to take measures to ensure streaming traffic from
the device is allowed back to the GVSP receiver. The expected usage of this is to send dummy UDP packets
from the GVSP receiver stream reception port to that GVSP transmitter source port, thus making the
streaming traffic appear to be requested by the GVSP receiver instead of unsolicited.

/*
Feature Name 			Interface 		   Access 		Units 					Description
“Width” 				IInteger 			R/(W) 		pixels 			Width of the image output by the camera on the stream channel.
“Height” 				IInteger 			R/(W) 		pixels 			Height of the image output by the camera on the stream channel.
																For linescan sources, this represents the height of the frame created 
																by combining consecutive lines together.
“PixelFormat” 		IEnumeration 		R/(W) 		N/A 			Format of the pixel output by the camera on the stream channel. Refer 
																to the Pixel format section (p.238)
“PayloadSize” 		IInteger 			R 			Bytes 			Maximum number of bytes transferred for eachimage on the stream channel, 
																including any end-ofline,end-of-frame statistics or other stamp data. This
																is the maximum total size of data payload for a	block. UDP and GVSP headers 
																are not considered.
																Data leader and data trailer are not included.
																This is mainly used by the application software to determine size of image 
																buffers to allocate (largest buffer possible for current mode of operation).
																For example, an image with no statistics or stamp data as PayloadSize equals 
																to (width x height x pixel size) in bytes. It is strongly recommended to 
																retrieve PayloadSize from the camera instead of relying on the above formula.
“GevSCPSPacketSize” 	IInteger 			R/W 		bytes 			Size of the GVSP packets to transmit during acquisition. This reflects the 
																packet_size field of the SCPS register associated to this stream channel.
																This feature MUST explicitly state the minimum,maximum and increment value 
																supported by the camera for GevSCPSPacketSize.
“AcquisitionMode” 	IEnumeration 		R/(W) 		N/A 	Used by application software to set the mode of acquisition. This feature indicates 
																how image are sequenced out of the camera (continuously, single shot, multi-shot, …)
																Only a single value is mandatory for GigE Vision.{“Continuous”}
																Continuous: Configures the camera to stream an infinite sequence of images that must 
																be stopped explicitly by the application.
																Note that the AcquistionMode can have more than this single entry. However, only this 
																one is mandatory.
																The “AcquisitionStart” and “AcquisitionStop”features are used to control the 
																acquisition state.
“AcquisitionStart” 	ICommand 			(R)/W 		N/A 	Start image acquisition using the specified acquisition mode.
“AcquisitionStop” 	ICommand 			(R)/W 		N/A 	Stop image acquisition using the specified acquisition mode.

//-------------------status code-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*This section lists the various status codes that can be returned in an acknowledge message or a GVSP
header. This specification defines two categories of status code:
1. Standard status code
2. Device-specific status code
Standard status codes are defined in this specification. Refer to appendix 2 for additional information about
supporting those codes.
[O-239cd] A device SHOULD return the status code that provides as much information as possible
about the source of error. [O18-1cd]
[R-240cd] If a device cannot return a more descriptive status code, the device MUST at least return
the GEV_STATUS_ERROR status code. [R18-2cd]
Status register is mapped as follows:

   0             1               2-3           4-15
severity device_specific_flag   reserved    status_value


severity 0 = info, 1 = error
device_specific_flag 0 for standard GigE Vision status codes,
1 for device-specific status codes
reserved Set to 0 on transmission, ignore on reception.
status_value Actual value of status code
